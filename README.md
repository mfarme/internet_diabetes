## Research Questions / Specific Aims
**Specific Aim 1:** To examine the longitudinal association between changes in county-level broadband internet adoption rates and changes in county-level self-reported diabetes prevalence over a two-year period, while controlling for other relevant social determinants of health.

Hypothesis 1:  Counties that experience an increase in broadband internet adoption rates between Year 1 and Year 2 will exhibit a corresponding decrease in self-reported diabetes prevalence between Year 1 and Year 2, after adjusting for changes in other SDOH.

**Specific Aim 2**: To identify the key intermediary factors (e.g., healthcare access, health behaviors, social support) that mediate the relationship between changes in internet adoption and changes in diabetes prevalence.

Hypothesis 2: The relationship between changes in internet adoption and changes in diabetes prevalence will be partially mediated by changes in intermediary factors such as access to healthcare services (e.g., having a usual source of care), health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, diet), and social support.
