# Longitudinal Analysis of Broadband Internet Adoption and Diabetes Prevalence in U.S. Counties: A First-Differences Approach

## **Background**

In our digital age, the internet has become a vital pathway for healthcare delivery, shaping how individuals manage their health and wellness. However, expansion of internet-dependent digital health solutions like telehealth, patient portals, virtual support communities, digitized health education, and individualized health applications, do not benefit everyone equally. In the United States, disparities in internet availability and adoption persist in many vulnerable populations 1–3. This contrasts with healthcare systems becoming more reliant on digital health tools, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic and global healthcare worker shortage 4.

As an emerging topic, the impact that internet availability and adoption have on disease prevalence is not well understood. Many researchers argue that the internet needs to be elevated as a social determinant of health, some taking an additional step claiming that the internet is a super-determinant, impacting all social determinants 5–9. The assumption of broadband internet as a social determinant of health is under-researched and the implications for population health is not well known.

To bridge this gap in understanding, our study aims to quantify the longitudinal relationships between broadband internet adoption rates in United States counties and self-reported diabetes prevalence, while controlling for other social determinants of health. Our findings have implications for population health, public health, and health policy research through generating evidence to understand internet adoption as a social determinant of health.

### **Diabetes Prevalence**

Diabetes prevalence has increased in U.S. counties steadily for decades. For example, median county-level diabetes prevalence increased from 7.8% in 2004 to 13.1% in 2016 10. While these estimates do not differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes accounts for over 90% of diagnoses. As a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and other complications, Type 2 diabetes is recognized as a potentially preventable disease that contributes to significant health and economic burden in the United States and worldwide 10,11. As public health researchers have theorized, the presence and usage of the internet in the home may be a mediator for other social determinants and positive health behaviors influencing diabetes prevalence. Since the internet creates additional access to health information, remote support communities, access to social resources, and digital health applications, its absence could lead to increased risk for diabetes development.

### **Internet Availability and Adoption.**

For clarity within this research, the terms internet availability and internet adoption are used to describe how populations are exposed to and interact with broadband internet. These two terms are defined as:

(1)   _Internet availability_ – denotes the existence of physical infrastructure capable of delivering broadband internet services as an option for internet connectivity in residential homes in a geographic area through fixed cable, DSL, or optical fiber by internet service providers.

(2)   _Internet adoption_ – denotes an intentional decision that results in the purchase and utilization of available broadband internet services in a residential household.

According to the Federal Communications Commission, in 2019 an estimated 21 million Americans did not have availability to broadband internet 12. However, this information is sourced from filings from Internet Service Providers (ISP) and have been contested as underreporting the true number of individuals without broadband internet access for reasons of poor methodology 13. Alternative numbers from Broadband Now suggest that the true number may be twice that with at least 42 million Americans who lack availability 14.

Regarding internet adoption, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) estimates that 18.2 million households have not adopted broadband internet 15. 13.8 million households report no need or no interest in having the internet at home while 4.4 million express it is too expensive. Population characteristics of non-adopters were those making less than $25,000 per year, people of color, or those with lower educational attainment.

### **Digital Health Access for People at Risk for Diabetes**

Recognition of pre-diabetes and diabetes prevention is enhanced by coordination with a provider, self-management behaviors, and personalized education. In our modern context, these can be accomplished through digital media like health apps, telehealth visits, and online education. A recent assessment of Medicare beneficiaries found that about six million members are eligible for the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) but are unable to access the benefit due to lack of Internet availability and digital technology. In recent years, availability of in-person support for MDPP has been limited due to lack of clinicians but virtual telehealth support is more readily available. Race, ethnicity, income, and education have been identified as factors contributing to the disconnection from these benefits 16.

In a landmark study placing internet adoption as an independent variable, Whitacre & Brooks (2014) assessed broadband adoption in Metro/Micropolitan statistical areas and health outcomes using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2002 to 2009. They found that higher levels of adoption had a significant and inverse relationship with diabetes prevalence in these areas17. Given that the availability and affordability of the internet and related technologies has improved considerably in the last 10 years, this relationship may have changed.

### **Conceptual Framework.**

The Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CDSH) framework18 aids in understanding the complex network of societal and individual factors that influence health equity, outcomes, and well-being. The framework includes a comprehensive view of the relationships that these factors have on health and well-being separated into two distinct parts: (1) _structural_ social determinants of health, and (2) _intermediary_ social determinants of health.

We used an adapted CSDH framework with the added concept of internet adoption. This is positioned within the structural determinant of health framework along with social position, education, occupation, and income, which subsequently impacts intermediary social determinants. The addition of the internet adoption as a structural component in the CDSH framework was operationalized most recently in a study by Joseph et al. (2023)19.

### **Prior Research:**

In an analysis of 2021 ACS and BRFSS data, analysis revealed significant negative association between internet adoption and diabetes prevalence (b = -0.20) suggests that when controlling for structural determinants of health (internet availability, education, demographics, occupation, income, and geographic location) greater internet adoption is associated with a lower prevalence of diabetes. This implies that increased access and usage of the internet may play a protective role against diabetes after accounting for socioeconomic and geographic factors. This could be due to several mechanisms including access to health information, access to telehealth services, online support networks, and access to social resources which can promote healthier behaviors. This is a similar finding to the recent work in a New Jersey population by Joseph et al., (2023) showing the odds of being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes were lower for those who have adopted the internet, while controlling for social determinants of health. Additionally, the second-stage regression results indicate that poor mental health (b=0.30), lack of health insurance(b=0.08), an annual check-up with a provider (b=0.05), and higher obesity rates (b=0.13) have a significant positive relationship to diabetes prevalence rates.

### **Limitations:**

Due to the county-level data analyzed, the findings do not reflect individual-level results. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and factors driving the association of internet adoption and diabetes prevalence to determine whether internet adoption can directly reduce the risk of developing diabetes.The estimation methodology for the ACS and BRFSS surveys creates limitations for accuracy. Non-response and non-sampling bias creates inaccurate estimates of county level data. However, weighted estimation methodology is applied in these data to mitigate the bias. Lastly, using self-reported diabetes prevalence can limit the findings due to recall bias, social desirability bias, or underreporting. Factors such as glycemic control, physical activity levels, medication adherence, and diet were not assessed in the study which can mediate the relationship with diabetes prevalence.

- **Adapted Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) Framework:**
    
    - Increased internet adoption → Improved access to health information → Better self-management behaviors → Reduced diabetes incidence/prevalence.
    - Increased internet adoption → Greater access to telehealth services → Improved diabetes management → Reduced complications and potentially lower prevalence over time.
    - Increased internet adoption → Enhanced social support networks → Improved mental health and coping mechanisms → Reduced diabetes risk.

# **Research Aims and Hypotheses**

- **Specific Aim 1:** To examine the longitudinal association between changes in county-level broadband internet adoption rates and changes in county-level self-reported diabetes prevalence over a two-year period, while controlling for other relevant social determinants of health.
    
    - **Hypothesis 1:** Counties that experience an increase in broadband internet adoption rates between Year 1 and Year 2 will exhibit a corresponding decrease in self-reported diabetes prevalence between Year 1 and Year 2, after adjusting for changes in other SDOH.
- **Specific Aim 2:** To identify the key intermediary factors (e.g., healthcare access, health behaviors, social support) that mediate the relationship between changes in internet adoption and changes in diabetes prevalence.
    
    - **Hypothesis 2:** The relationship between changes in internet adoption and changes in diabetes prevalence will be partially mediated by changes in intermediary factors such as access to healthcare services (e.g., having a usual source of care), health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, diet), and social support.

## **Data Sources**

- **Independent Variable of Primary Interest:**
    - Change in broadband internet adoption rate - ACS (Year 2 adoption rate - Year 1 adoption rate)
- **Control Variables (Structural Determinants):**
    - Changes in:
        - Percentage of population below poverty level
        - Percentage of population with different levels of education (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree)
        - Percentage of population in different racial/ethnic groups
        - Percentage of population employed in different occupations
        - Median household income
        - RUCA code (categorized)
        - Internet Availability
- **Intermediary Variables (if available in BRFSS):**
    - Changes in:
        - Percentage of population with health insurance
        - Percentage of population with a usual source of care
        - Percentage of population engaging in regular physical activity
        - Percentage of population with obesity
        - Percentage of population reporting poor mental health
        - Other relevant health behaviors or access measures

## **Statistical Analysis**

- **Data Preparation:**
    - Merge the ACS, BRFSS, RUCA data for the two selected years, matching by county FIPS codes.
    - Create difference variables (Year 2 - Year 1) for all continuous variables.
    - Handle any inconsistencies in county naming or coding across datasets.
- **Descriptive Statistics:**
    - Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, range, etc.) for all variables at both time points and for the difference variables.
    - Examine distributions and identify any potential outliers or influential observations.
- **First-Differences Regression:**
    - Employ a first-differences regression model to estimate the relationship between changes in internet adoption and changes in diabetes prevalence. The model will take the following form:
        
        ΔDiabetesi=β0+β1ΔInternetAdoptioni+β2ΔControlsi+εiΔDiabetesi=β0+β1ΔInternetAdoptioni+β2ΔControlsi+εi
        
        Where:
        
        - ΔDiabetesiΔDiabetesi is the change in diabetes prevalence in county _i_.
        - ΔInternetAdoptioniΔInternetAdoptioni is the change in internet adoption in county _i_.
        - ΔControlsiΔControlsi is a vector of changes in control variables for county _i_.
        - εiεi is the error term.
    - Use heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.
        
    - Test for multicollinearity among the independent variables.
        
- **Mediation Analysis:**
    - If the primary regression shows a significant association between changes in internet adoption and changes in diabetes prevalence, conduct a mediation analysis to explore the role of intermediary variables.
    - Use a method appropriate for testing mediation with continuous variables (e.g., the product-of-coefficients approach with bootstrapping).
- **Sensitivity Analyses:**
    - Consider alternative specifications of the model, such as including lagged variables (e.g., using Year 1 internet adoption to predict Year 2 diabetes prevalence).
    - Explore potential non-linear relationships using appropriate techniques (e.g., adding quadratic terms, using splines).
- **Machine Learning:**
    - As a supplementary analysis, I will explore machine learning models (e.g., gradient boosting, random forests) to predict changes in diabetes prevalence. This can help identify complex interactions and non-linearities that might be missed by the linear regression model. Compare the predictive performance of the machine learning models to the first-differences regression.

# **Potential Impact of Findings**

- **Inform Policy and Interventions:** Discuss how the findings could inform policies and interventions aimed at increasing internet access and reducing diabetes disparities. For example, if a strong longitudinal association is found, it would provide further evidence for the importance of investing in broadband infrastructure and digital literacy programs, particularly in underserved communities.
- **Advance Understanding of SDOH:** Emphasize how the study will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay between social determinants of health, internet access, and health outcomes.
- **Guide Future Research:** Suggest directions for future research, such as investigating the specific mechanisms through which internet access influences diabetes risk and management, exploring the role of different types of internet use (e.g., telehealth, health information seeking), and conducting qualitative studies to understand the lived experiences of individuals with limited internet access.
